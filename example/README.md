# Example

This folder contains sample input files and a pre-generated report to help you get started with Canal.

> **Disclaimer:** The data in `example_data.csv` (both reference and generated text) was synthetically generated by an LLM. It does not represent real patient records or actual ASR system output.

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `example_data.csv` | CSV with 10 transcript pairs (`ref` and `gen` columns) containing realistic ASR errors (misspellings, extra words, and missing words). |
| `example_keywords.txt` | List of 33 medical terms (single- and multi-word) used for Medical Term Recall. |
| `example_report.html` | Pre-generated HTML report — open in any browser to see the output. |

## Reproducing the report

```bash
canal report --medical-terms example/example_keywords.txt --output-path example/example_report.html example/example_data.csv
```
